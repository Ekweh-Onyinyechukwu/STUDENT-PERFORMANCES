# STUDENT-PERFORMANCES

# Overview of Dataset Analysis

## Dataset Description
The dataset "student-por.csv" contains comprehensive information about student performance and socio-economic factors that potentially influence academic outcomes. It includes data such as student grades (G1, G2, G3), demographic details (sex, age), family background (parental education, family size), lifestyle choices (alcohol consumption, study time), and support systems (school support, family support).

## Purpose of Analysis
The primary goal of analyzing this dataset is to uncover insights that can aid stakeholders in understanding the factors impacting student performance. By exploring relationships between different variables, we aim to identify patterns and trends that could inform educational policies, interventions, and support systems.

## Key Analyses Conducted
1. **Distribution of Final Grades (G3):**
   - Analyzed to understand the overall distribution of student performance.
   
2. **Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Grades:**
   - Investigated the relationship between alcohol consumption (weekday and weekend) and final grades.
   
3. **Relationship Between Travel Time and Study Time:**
   - Explored how travel time to school influences the amount of time students spend studying.
   
4. **Effect of Internet Access on Grades:**
   - Examined whether students with internet access at home tend to perform better academically.
